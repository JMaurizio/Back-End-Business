# Back-End-Business

## Description

Back End Business is a back end application using Express.js, MySQL2 and Sequelize.  The goal of this application is to showcase how an e-commerce sites database could be structured and used at multiple api endpoints.  To showcase this the routes made were tested using Insomina in the video below.

## Installation

To install and test the application for yourself.  First clone the repository then after that run the command "npm install" in the terminal to install the necessary dependancies.  Next to setup the mock database you will need to log into MySQL and run the command "source db/schema.sql" after that return to the terminal and enter the command "npm run seed".  Once all of this is done you can start the application with the command "npm start" and then proceed to test the endpoints for yourself in Insomnia or whichever software you prefer to use.
